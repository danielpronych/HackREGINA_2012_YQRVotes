<h1>City Council Candidates</h1>

<h2>Ward 1</h2>
<div name="CandidateArmstrong">Rob Armstrong - "Transparent, Trusted, Transcendent"
<p>My name is Rob Armstrong, and I am running for Regina City Council in Ward 1. I have been a resident of Ward 1 since moving to Regina in 2010. In our time here, my wife Andrea and I have been afforded many opportunities to succeed. I am a board member of Regina Lyric Musical Theatre, and I frequently perform in various local productions.</p>

<p>Running for City Council is a way for me to give back to the city. We live in a diverse, vibrant community, and I want to see the city continue to grow and prosper. We need to establish a balance between continued growth and maintaining current infrastructure. When elected, I will strive for complete transparency from every member of city council. I will hold myself accountable for every decision that I make, and every word that I speak.</p>

<div name="CandidateHewitt">Conrad Hewitt - "A Fresh Perspective for Regina City Council"
<p>My name is Conrad Hewitt and I’m running for Regina City Council in Ward 1. Ward 1 has been my home for nearly my entire life. In that time I have lived, worked, played, and volunteered in the Ward and developed a real understanding of the sense of community that is present here. As one big community, we all share some common concerns about the state of our city. I believe it is time that Ward 1 had a strong voice to make these concerns heard.</p>

<p>I have worked hard to make my community better through my school, church, community council and other volunteer initiatives, but I want to do more. This is why I am running for Regina City Council. I’m looking forward to working even harder for the residents of Ward 1, and to bringing a fresh perspective to Regina City Council this fall.</p>

<div name="CandidateKlein">John Klein - "New Voice... Positive Choice"
<p>John Klein is a 32 year old IT professional, employed at the University of Regina. He is also the President of the Regina Car Share Co-operative, which provides additional transportation service to our city.</p>

<p>John has lived in Regina's Ward 1 beginning in 1998 while attending university, and now in a condo with his wife April.</p>

<p>Key areas to make our city prepared for growth are:</p>

    <ul>
	<li>Infrastructure - Streets & sidewalks attended to before sufficiently drivable and walkable ones are redone. A stadium proposal where public input and private funding are both greater.</li>
    <li>Rental housing crisis - Rental supply immediately increased.</li>
    <li>City services - Waste management (recycling/composting), and Transit improved.</li>
    <li>Open Government - Citizens able to address Council with the expectation that their views will be considered.</li>
	</ul>

<p>When elected, John will donate a large percentage of his Councillor salary to Ward 1 community associations.</p>

<div name="CandidateKuster">Shawn Kuster - "Together lets make Ward 1 and Regina Great"
<p>Born and raised in Regina I completed a Bachelor of Education Degree from the University of Regina before moving to Calgary to complete a Masters of Kinesiology Degree. Valuing the many benefits of the Regina community, my wife Jody and I chose to return in 1994 to start a family.  We have lived in Ward 1 with our four children for the past 18 years.</p>

<p>I would look forward to your input while representing our community on issues such as:</p>

    <ul>
	<li>Balance city growth with repair & maintenance of infrastructure in existing communities</li>
    <li>Responsible and affordable taxation for all residents</li>
    <li>Reduction in personal and property crime</li>
    <li>Allowing homeowners opportunities to update their homes without increased taxation</li>
    <li>Enhance and maintain green space and recreational areas</li>
    <li>Increase transparency and accountability of City Council’s decisions</li>
    <li>A commitment that future development and programs are citizen centered and sustainable both environmentally and economically into the future.</li>
	</ul>
