						My name is Rob Armstrong, and I am running for Regina City Council in Ward 1. I have been a resident of Ward 1 since moving to Regina in 2010. In our time here, my wife Andrea and I have been afforded many opportunities to succeed. I am a board member of Regina Lyric Musical Theatre, and I frequently perform in various local productions.

						Running for City Council is a way for me to give back to the city. We live in a diverse, vibrant community, and I want to see the city continue to grow and prosper. We need to establish a balance between continued growth and maintaining current infrastructure. When elected, I will strive for complete transparency from every member of city council. I will hold myself accountable for every decision that I make, and every word that I speak.

						My name is Conrad Hewitt and I’m running for Regina City Council in Ward 1. Ward 1 has been my home for nearly my entire life. In that time I have lived, worked, played, and volunteered in the Ward and developed a real understanding of the sense of community that is present here. As one big community, we all share some common concerns about the state of our city. I believe it is time that Ward 1 had a strong voice to make these concerns heard.

						I have worked hard to make my community better through my school, church, community council and other volunteer initiatives, but I want to do more. This is why I am running for Regina City Council. I’m looking forward to working even harder for the residents of Ward 1, and to bringing a fresh perspective to Regina City Council this fall.

						John Klein is a 32 year old IT professional, employed at the University of Regina. He is also the President of the Regina Car Share Co-operative, which provides additional transportation service to our city.
						<br />
						John has lived in Regina's Ward 1 beginning in 1998 while attending university, and now in a condo with his wife April.
						Key areas to make our city prepared for growth are:
						<br />
						Infrastructure - Streets & sidewalks attended to before sufficiently drivable and walkable ones are redone. A stadium proposal where public input and private funding are both greater.
						<br />
						Rental housing crisis - Rental supply immediately increased.
						<br />
						City services - Waste management (recycling/composting), and Transit improved.
						<br />
						Open Government - Citizens able to address Council with the expectation that their views will be considered.

						Born and raised in Regina I completed a Bachelor of Education Degree from the University of Regina before moving to Calgary to complete a Masters of Kinesiology Degree. Valuing the many benefits of the Regina community, my wife Jody and I chose to return in 1994 to start a family.  We have lived in Ward 1 with our four children for the past 18 years.<br />

						I would look forward to your input while representing our community on issues such as: <br />
						Balance city growth with repair & maintenance of infrastructure in existing communities <br />
						Responsible and affordable taxation for all residents <br />
						Reduction in personal and property crime <br />
						Allowing homeowners opportunities to update their homes without increased taxation <br />
						Enhance and maintain green space and recreational areas<br />
						Increase transparency and accountability of City Council’s decisions<br />
						A commitment that future development and programs are citizen centered and sustainable both environmentally and economically into the future.<br />

						As a proud resident of Ward One, I am seeking the opportunity to represent you on City Council. My wife and I have lived in Regina all of our lives and have had the pleasure of residing in Whitmore Park for the past five years.  I received my Bachelor of Business Administration from the U of R in 2005 and my Project Management Professional designation in 2009.  I am currently employed as a Project Manager at Fujitsu Canada.  As a volunteer, I have contributed to our community in several roles including Chair of the Regina Arts Advisory Committee and President of the Whitmore Park Community Association.<br />

						I am passionate about working for my community and addressing issues important to Ward One.  I would make it a priority to expedite infrastructure replacement, create additional community spaces for culture and recreation and help to ensure transparency and accountability in municipal government.
